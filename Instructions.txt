Ceresti Health To Do List
Author: Deryl Lam

Description: 

This is a simple to do list which allows the user to delete a task, 
delete all tasks, insert a task, view a task or all the tasks, and edit a task. Tasks
 have a due date, a title, and an option that will allow the user to change the status of their task
to finished or still working.

Instructions:

1. Transfer files to xampp folder. Go to your xampp folder (usually in C:\) and open it. Next, open your htdocs folder and 
insert all provided files so xampp can recognize them for the local server.

2. Go back to your xampp folder and double click the xampp_start batch file. This will run the local server.

3. Open up an internet browser (I used google chrome) and type this into the navigation bar: http://localhost/index.html

4. You are now looking at the To Do list app. Type your task in the description bar and due date in the appropriate box. You can also 
check the task completed box to show that you've finished it or leave it blank if you haven't.

5. Click the new task button to commit your task. You should now be able to see your task listed on the bottom.

6. To add a new task, simply enter in your task and click new task to commit it to the list.

7. To delete a task, simply click the delete button on the task you want.

8. To edit a task and view a single task, simply click the edit button. Your task should be displayed in the Task Description and Due Date bars. 
You can change the due date our your task description and then click update to commit the changes.

9. To delete all tasks, click delete all.

10. If you've completed a task, simply click the box under Completed for the task you want to show that it's complete.
